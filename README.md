# 100_Days_Of_DataAnalytics

I've decided to participate in the 100DaysofDataAnalytics Challenge, in which I'll spend each day focusing on problem solving and personal projects in order to enhance my abilities and push my limits.

I'm coming back after an unsuccessful efforts by publicly committing to the 100DaysOfDataAnalytics Challenge, which begins today!

### I'm going to stick to two main principles:
1. Spend at least an hour coding every day for the following 100 days.
2. Use the hashtag #100DaysOfDataAnalytics to tweet your progress every day.


### My Exceptions: 
1. If I break the streak, I'll make sure I don't do it again the next day.
2. Due to my corporate business and a few unforeseen circumstances, I need to take a day off.
