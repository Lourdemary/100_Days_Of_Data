I've decided to participate in the 100DaysofData Challenge, in which I'll spend each day focusing on problem solving and personal projects in order to enhance my abilities and push my limits.

I'm coming back after an unsuccessful efforts by publicly committing to the 100DaysOfData Challenge, which begins today!

### I'm going to stick to two main principles:
1. Spend at least an hour learning every day for the following 100 days.
2. Use the hashtag #100DaysOfData to tweet your progress every day.


### My Exceptions: 
1. If I break the streak, I'll make sure I don't do it again the next day.
2. Due to my corporate business and a few unforeseen circumstances, I need to take a day off.

For Daily updates, follow me on:

My aim is to complete 100DaysOfData in order to get the skills necessary to become an entry-level data analyst by: 
1. Documenting my course progress 
2. Showcasing my abilities
3. Assembling the materials
4. Making connections
5. Ease of access for me in the future
